After allowing friends, family, co-workers as well as other students to view my app, the feedback I got was mostly in regards
to the aesthetics of the page.  Some liked the colors, some didn't like them.  Some thought my picture was too small, some thought it was
perfect. Some felt my footer should be a little taller, the list goes on. It was an ebb and flow of everyone's honest personal opinions
on display, assuredly all verbiage was meant to help the app be better, in whatever way they felt it could or should be.
